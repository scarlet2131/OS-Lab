Assignments:
1. Write a program in C/C++ language to create a process using fork(), exit() and wait() system calls. The child process will compute nth Fibonacci number and the result will be printed by the parent process. The value of n will be inputted through command line argument.       [Marks: 7]

2. Write a program in C/C++ language that will create two processes among which one will read data from user (The user will be asked for how many data will be entered) into a circular queue (use linked list only) and the other will print data (The user will be asked for how many data will be printed) from the circular queue (use linked list only). Appropriate message should be printed if the queue is empty or full. The queue should be initialised by the parent process. Your program should maintain proper synchronisation between two processes.
