1. Write a program in C/C++ language to solve readers writers problem using semaphore. There will be three writer threads and two reader threads. Each writer will write one paragraph in a file. On the other hand, one reader thread will read (display at the output) the first paragraph and second thread will read (display at the output) the last two paragraphs. User will give appropriate input about which thread will read which paragraph. Implement your program using necessary semaphore variables. Your program should maintain the necessary synchronization requirements to solve the readers writers problem as discussed in class.
